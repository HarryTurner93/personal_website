            A few months ago, I almost got tricked into joining a pyramid scheme. I don't consider myself
            someone who usually falls for that sort of thing but that's probably why I almost did.
            I'm writing this now because I thought it would be an
            interesting lesson worth sharing, mostly so that others don't also fall into the same trap. I'm writing
            it as a story, sprinkled throughout with some of my observations in hindsight. I hope you find it enlightening.
